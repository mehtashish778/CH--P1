It is widely used in the manufacture of unsaturated polyester resins, polyurethanes, nitrocellulose, resins and plasticizers. It plays an important role as a building block in the preparation of morpholine and 1,4-dioxane. It finds application as a heat transfer fluid in the chemical industry due to its low freezing point. As a lubricant, it is used in glass-grinding aids, fiber-finish component and cement-grinding aids. It is also used in natural gas to remove water and other impurities. It is an active component of brake fluid, artificial fog solutions and wallpaper strippers. This Thermo Scientific Chemicals brand product was originally part of the Alfa Aesar product portfolio.

It is involved in the preparation of the esterification coupling reagent, di-2-thienyl carbonate from 2(5H)-thiophenone. Further, it is used as a reagent in organic synthesis and converts an amino group into isocyanate. In addition to this, it is employed in the preparation of 2-chloronicotinaldehydes through cyclization of the corresponding enamides. It is considered as a useful substitute for phosgene.

It was used in isolation of palmitylated peptide fragment from bovine rhodopsin and its characterization by mass spectrometry. It has been used as a liquid matrix for fast atom bombardment[1] and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization. In electrospray ionization 3-NBA is doped into low surface tension spray solvents to increase analyte charging.

In addition to this, it is employed in the Hofmann rearrangement for the conversion of cyclobutanecarboxamide to cyclobutylamine hydrochloride.

It is a useful as model compound in catalytic chemistry to represent the a-O4 ether bond in lignin and coal. It contains a weak ether bond of 234kJ/mol and belongs to the most thermo-labile compounds in lignin and low rank coal. Influence of alkali carbonates, common additives in biomass conversion, on the reaction pathways of BPE in superheated water has been reported. Cesium-exchanged heteropolyacid catalyzed decomposition of benzyl phenyl ether to aromatics has been investigated. Photo-Claisen rearrangements of benzyl phenyl ether was investigated in cation-exchanged Y zeolites and polyethylenes of differing crystallinities.

It is found to accept electrons from Li metal to give a radical anion which is highly effective in the conversion of alkyl halides to alkyllithiums. 4,4?-Di-tert-butylbiphenyl is used in production of homoallylic amine derivatives. It is also used in the preparation of lithium di-tert-butylbiphenylide, a radical anion, superior to sodium or lithium naphthalenides for metalation reactions. Along with lithium,  4,4?-Di-tert-butylbiphenyl  catalyzes; reaction of chloromethyl ethyl ether and different carbonyl compounds to yield corresponding hydroxyethers and reductive opening of N-phenylazetidine.
